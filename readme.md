# Planetary Processing Godot Plugin

Planetary processing is a platform for the creation and operation of multiplayer games; we provide a plugin for integrating our platform with the Godot Engine. The plugin provides nodes and signals to use within your game client code - these communicate changes in state from your server side simulation to the game client itself.
