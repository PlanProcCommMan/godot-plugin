# Planetary Processing Godot Plugin

Planetary processing provides a plugin for the Godot Engine. The plugin allows you to define your entities and their server side code within the Godot editor. Additionally, the plugin provides signals to connect to in your game client code - these communicate changes in state from your server side simulation to the game client itself.
